title: Lord Krsna with his divine companions (57cm by 48cm) Embroidery and patchwork
summary: Lord Krishna shares a deep, loving bond with all animalsâ€”gently herding the cows of Vrindavan and playing joyfully with calves, monkeys, and peacocks. His presence brings peace to every creature, who instinctively gather around him, drawn by his divine charm and compassion.
