Kiran Khanna was born amid the tranquil hills of **Dalhousie, India**, and has been rooted in **Australia** for more than a decade. Working primarily in *embroidery* and *patchwork*, her practice is a meditation on **Sanatana Dharma** and *Krishna consciousness*‚Äîeach stitch an offering of joy, reverence, and connection to the Divine.

During the opening night of the **HousingFirst MAB Annual Art Exhibition (2025)**, Kiran displayed four pieces‚Äî*Vrinda Devi*, *Vrindavan Groves*, *Harmony*, and *Radha Kunda*. Her work **_Vrinda Devi_** received the *Most Commended Award*, recognised as the best artwork of the show.

Kiran is currently developing a new series that explores sacred forests (*vana-lƒ´lƒÅ*) and the symbolism of yogic postures, continuing her mission to weave devotion into contemporary textile art.
